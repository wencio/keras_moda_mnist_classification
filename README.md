# Image Classification with TensorFlow and Keras

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to train a neural network model to classify images of clothing, such as shoes and shirts, using TensorFlow and Keras. It uses the Fashion MNIST dataset, a popular dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

## Project Structure
- `keras_mode_image.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code and explanations.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview and instructions.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
   ```

### Running the Notebook
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `classification.ipynb` and run all cells to execute the code.

## Code Explanation

### Import Libraries
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
These libraries are necessary for building, training, and visualizing the neural network model.

### Load and Prepare the Data
```python
fashion_mnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data()
```
This loads the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories.

### Normalize the Images
```python
train_images = train_images / 255.0
test_images = test_images / 255.0
```
Normalization scales the pixel values to a range of 0 to 1, which helps in speeding up the training process.

### Build the Model
```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
```
The model is a simple feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer.

### Compile the Model
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```
Compilation configures the model for training, specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

### Train the Model
```python
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)
```
The model is trained for 10 epochs using the training data.

### Evaluate the Model
```python
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)
print('\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)
```
The model is evaluated on the test dataset to measure its accuracy.

### Make Predictions
```python
probability_model = tf.keras.Sequential([model, 
                                         tf.keras.layers.Softmax()])
predictions = probability_model.predict(test_images)
```
Predictions are made on the test images, and the results are probabilities for each class.

### Visualize Predictions
Functions are defined to visualize the predictions made by the model:
```python
def plot_image(i, predictions_array, true_label, img):
    # code for plotting a single image and its prediction

def plot_value_array(i, predictions_array, true_label):
    # code for plotting the prediction probabilities
```
